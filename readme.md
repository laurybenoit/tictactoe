## Issues 
Main issues I encounter:
- Understanding the logic of the game 
- Initializing the game board
- Writing a condition for winner
- Stoping the game if there is a winner

## What I have Learned 
- DOM element to manipulated different part of my project

## Changes/Later Implementation
- Spend so long creating the Board, and the look of it
- I would love to create a backend that would capture the player data such as name and their previous score
